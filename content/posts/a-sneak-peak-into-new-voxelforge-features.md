Get your armor ready, and prepare your weapons, cause we've got big news.

You ever get tired of reaching the world edge in an hour ? 
You tired of beautiful terrain generation suddenly cut off ?

Well recently we've forked the MT engine and we're giving it an update. 
We're changing the world size from 16 bit integer (31007 map limit) to 32 bit integer (meaning the generation nubmer is a whopping 2,147,483,008 (much much much bigger)) 
The only downside is database size, which is why we will not be making that giant number the average.

However that's not all. We've also been working on updating liquids to be more minecraft like, and also we've been adding, glow to node textures, better shaders, animated inventory images, and more.
Stay tuned for more details on development.
