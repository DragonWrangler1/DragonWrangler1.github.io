Hello. Today We've released a new Weekly dev release for VoxelForge. This one finishes up some old features, and fixes several bugs.

## Experimental Features

### Bundles
 - Bundles now have new images .
   (Editor's Note: the old ones were only 22% different from MC meaning we only had a 2% buffer can you imagine that ? Only 2%.)

## Changes
 - Added Datapacks.
   (Editor's Note: Currently unused)
 - New 1.21 Banner Patterns.
 - New 1.21 Pottery Sherds.
 - New 1.21 Armor Trims.
 - finished candles. 
   (Editor's Note: Before this candles were just candles, and when lit did nothing but glow)
 - Villager Traders now have an exp bar to indicate when they will level up.
 - Updated some translations.
 - Updated some textures. (Editor's Note: mainly for bundles)
 - removed frost status effect as it did not ever exist in MineCraft.
 - Mounted horses now have improved gravity.
 - Added new vlf_lib mod.
 - Very crude way of making players go down ladders when they aren't attempting to go up 
   (Editor's Note: very crude and very slow)
