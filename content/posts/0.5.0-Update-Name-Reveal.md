Well. After a while of teasing you all with the update name 'Ominous Winds' We will finally reveal the actual name. 
Not only that, but we will also move VoxelForge into a new version stage: Beta. 
We've fixed so many bugs, and the game is mostly stable, which is why we're removing Alpha tag. Some may have noticed the WIP tag has already been removed from ContentDB a while back.

That being said we are pleased to announce that **the 0.5.0 update will be named... Traps & Treasures!**

And if all goes well the **Traps & Treasures Update** will be released on... **October 3rd 4:00 p.m. EDT!**

Which means in 7 days!

Now one important question:

## What Features are your favorite? ##
From Wolf armor, to ominous vaults. This update is packed full of new features. Tell us your favorite on the MT forums.

Watch out for some release candidates in the coming days. as we make the final countdown to Release day.

Now with all that having been said. Go have some fun, have a good day. And we'll see you all again very soon.
